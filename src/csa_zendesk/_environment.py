"""Environment facts for `report_a_problem`, and the one question it could not answer: is this
copy current?

`report_a_problem` reported the installed version and never asked whether it was the latest, so a
careful bug report could be written in detail against something fixed three releases ago - the
reporter's time first, the maintainer's second (#27).

**Where the check runs is the whole design.** Not at startup: a stdio server should not reach the
network because it booted, and a launch that waits on PyPI is a launch that hangs when PyPI is
slow. Not on errors either - an ordinary refusal (policy denied, message not found) is an error
here, and checking a package index on each would be both wrong and noisy. Filing a report is
already a deliberate act, and being current is exactly what matters at that moment, so that is the
only caller that passes `check_pypi=True`.

Everything else here is offline and touches nothing outside this package.

    Ported from `csa-google-workspace/_environment.py`, whose docstring carries the fuller
    reasoning and the measurements behind it. The short version: the routes fail differently, so
    the field changes what a maintainer reads a report as. A pipx or uv-tool venv is isolated and
    upgrades cleanly; a shared environment can have another project's pin holding the version
    down, which is its own explanation for a stale report; an editable checkout is somebody's
    working tree that may match no release at all.

    `uv` ADJACENT to `tools`, not two separate `in` checks, because `/home/uv/projects/tools/...`
    is an ordinary path. The two uv layouts differ - POSIX has a `pythonX.Y` level and Windows
    does not - and adjacency is the part common to both.

    **Residual, inherited along with the code:** this answers where the package LIVES, not how it
    was installed, so a `UV_TOOL_DIR` or `PIPX_HOME` pointing somewhere without the giveaway
    segment falls through to `pip (venv)`. Definitive markers exist (`uv-receipt.toml`,
    `uv = <version>` in `pyvenv.cfg`) but both are filesystem reads this module does not take.
    It is a triage hint on a bug report, not something a decision rests on.
