"""Zendesk HTML becomes Markdown here, and nowhere else.

DEC-018: when content crosses to a model, Markdown is the representation.
This module is the whole transform for csa-zendesk, and it is PURE - no HTTP,
no tokens, no filesystem - so it can be tested exhaustively offline.

Reads `html_body` and never `body`. Measured 2026-09-22: Zendesk's own
plain-text rendering is a naive tag strip - all five CSS-hidden probes survived
into `body` while the CSS that reveals them did not. The flattened form keeps
the payload and destroys the evidence, so it is strictly worse than the HTML.

#: Codepoints stripped because they have no legitimate use in prose. STRIPPED,
#: never folded (see `strip_suspicious`'s docstring on why folding is worse).
#:
#: Corrected 2026-09-22: a first version of this set was written from the
#: threat list alone (zero-width space, ZWNJ, ZWJ, LRM/RLM, bidi EMBEDDING,
#: bidi isolates, tag characters, soft hyphen, Mongolian vowel separator) and
#: never checked against a legitimacy list. Measured against real script
#: usage, it damaged seven legitimate cases: Persian ZWNJ is SEMANTIC
#: (می‌رود "mi-ravad" vs میرود are different words), ZWJ is required for
#: Arabic letter shaping, Indic conjuncts and emoji ZWJ sequences (a family
#: emoji decomposes into three separate people without it), LRM/RLM are
#: legitimate directional marks, bidi EMBEDDING (as opposed to override) is
#: ordinary right-to-left text, and tag characters compose subdivision-flag
#: emoji (Scotland's flag becomes a plain black flag without them). None of
#: that is stripped now.
#:
#: Corrected again 2026-09-22 (round 2): WORD JOINER (0x2060) was added to
#: this set without being checked against a legitimacy corpus either - the
#: same defect reproduced at small scale. It is the functional complement of
#: ZWSP (ZWSP permits a break where none would otherwise occur; WJ suppresses
#: one that otherwise would happen), so the same reasoning that got ZWSP
#: dropped applies to WJ: it binds a number to its unit, holds an
#: abbreviation together, and prevents a mid-token break in technical or
#: legal text. Also not stripped now.
#:
#: The rest of the original threat list stays off for reasons of its own,
#: not just "it was on the list": bidi ISOLATES (0x2066-0x2069, LRI/RLI/FSI/
#: PDI) are the modern, recommended replacement for the 0x202A-0x202C
#: embedding controls - they scope directionality without the leakage
#: embeddings suffer, and are ordinary in mixed-direction text. Soft hyphen
#: (0x00AD) is a legitimate hyphenation hint, invisible unless the renderer
#: actually breaks there, and ubiquitous in justified text produced by word
#: processors. The Mongolian vowel separator (0x180E) is legitimate in
#: Mongolian script.
#:
#: What remains: the Trojan Source bidi-OVERRIDE pair (LRO/RLO reorder how
#: text renders without reordering the source, which is how `invoice[RLO]
#: fdp.exe` displays as `invoice.exe`, with no legitimate prose use), a
#: mid-document BOM, and C0 controls other than tab/LF/CR.
#:
#: Consequence, not an oversight: this no longer defangs the observed
#: zero-width-signature attack (U+200C interleaved through a name), because
#: U+200C cannot be stripped unconditionally without breaking Persian and
#: Indic text. Catching that needs a density-based detector, deliberately out
#: of scope here - see
#: `test_a_zero_width_signature_attack_is_NOT_defanged_by_stripping`.

    Strips: the Trojan Source bidi-override pair (LRO/RLO), a mid-document
    BOM, and C0 controls other than tab/LF/CR.

    Deliberately NOT stripped, because each has a real, meaning-bearing use
    somewhere in ordinary text: ZWSP (Thai/Khmer word segmentation), ZWNJ
    (semantic in Persian and Indic scripts), ZWJ (Arabic letter shaping,
    Indic conjuncts, emoji ZWJ sequences), LRM/RLM (legitimate directional
    marks), bidi EMBEDDING codepoints (ordinary right-to-left text, as
    opposed to override), bidi ISOLATES (the modern, recommended replacement
    for embedding - they scope directionality without embedding's leakage),
    tag characters (subdivision-flag emoji), soft hyphen (a hyphenation
    hint, invisible unless the renderer actually breaks there), the
    Mongolian vowel separator (legitimate in Mongolian script), and the WORD
    JOINER (the functional complement of ZWSP - it suppresses a break rather
    than permitting one, e.g. binding a number to its unit or holding an
    abbreviation together). A broader first version of this set stripped
    ZWSP, ZWNJ, ZWJ, LRM/RLM, bidi EMBEDDING, tag characters, bidi isolates,
    soft hyphen and the Mongolian vowel separator, and was measured to
    damage seven languages/scripts; a second pass added WORD JOINER without
    the same check and had to be corrected again. This is what survived
    checking against a legitimacy list, not just a threat list. One
    consequence of that: this function does NOT defang the
    zero-width-signature attack (U+200C interleaved through a name) - see
    `test_a_zero_width_signature_attack_is_NOT_defanged_by_stripping`.

    NOT a homoglyph check. A rule that flags mixed scripts within a word also
    flags Indigenous orthographies (Musqueam contains a Greek theta, because
    IPA-derived characters are its standard written form) and IPA
    transcriptions. That rule is measured at 6-of-8 false positives against
    legitimate content and is deliberately absent here.
